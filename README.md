Display your tweets on a tiny 16x2 LCD with this project! This repository contains all the necessary files to get you started.

  * Hardware: This folder contains the schematic. I simply soldered everything on a protoboard. But you are more than welcome to create a custom PCB!
  * Software: This folder contains all the node.js files that fetch data fromt the Twitter and send it your Core via the Spark Cloud.
  * Firmware: This folder contains the firmware that goes on to your Core. Simply copy+paste twitter-magnet.cpp in the Spark web IDE and flash your core.
